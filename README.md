# Bikesharing Project

This proposal looks briefly into the New Yor Citi Bike business experience and proposes copying the same business model to Des Moines. Prior to doing that, this project will go through various aspects of the business in order to examine the feasibility of the business idea and its worth. Additionally, some details and statistical analyses will be provided along with some visualizations that illustrate the idea better.

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

### Initial Look at the Project
The main purpose of this analysis is to examine the worth of the business idea and whether it is a good fit for investors to invest in. This analysis attempted to answer some important questions about the project, such as (1) what is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers, and (2) what are the peak hours for bike rentals? Over all, there were over two and a quarter million trips that occured in the month of August alone. When investigating that number further, the analysis showed that 81% of these trips were made by existing subscribers (1,900,359 subscriber), and the remaining 19% were regular customers.

Furthermore, the peak hours of these trips seemed to be between 4 pm to 8 pm. This is important to know so that enough bikes are supplied for the customers in the time of need. Additionally, there is a brief high demand also in the morning time between 7 am through 8 am. This is also another thing to take into consideration.

Having identified the busiest times of the day, another important thing to look at was the duration of each trip. This is important, as well, in order to identify or predict when each bike will be returned when it is checked out. Overall, the results show that the trip duration fall bellow one hour. The distribution of the trips seem positively skewed with an average of about eight minutes per trip.

Digging deeper into this analysis, the trip duration was broken down by gender to see any disparities and identify which gender use the bikes more. Results of the analysis showed that the vast majority of the riders are male riders. Following male riders, female riders constituted a good proportion of the trips followed by people of unknown gender.

Having identified riders by gender, it is plausible to look at the days of the week and investigate how busy each day is and whether one dya is besier that the others. The analysis shown in the hearmap below reveals that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday follow the same pattern and density, i.e. trips are higher in the morning and afternoon. This could be accrued to the fact that these are the times when people are going to work and/or school and coming back. Wednesday seem to demonstrate lower trips than the rest of the weekdays. Unlike weekdays, the weekeneds seem to be busiest during midday with Saturdays being a bit busier. This is understandable because that is the time pople are out abd about enjoying their weekends and running some errands.

Of course, when breaking that heatmap down by gender, we see that the majority of the trips were conducted by male riders.

For a more comprehensive loook at the data, trips were analysed by week day, gender, and customer type. Interestingly, results were quite not what we thought. While male subscribers remained the dominant riders, female subscribers were more than male regular customers. This is interesting because the previous charts did not show that (or we did not look into it :D).
