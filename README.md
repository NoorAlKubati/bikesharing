# Bikesharing Project

This proposal looks briefly into the New Yor Citi Bike business experience and proposes copying the same business model to Des Moines. Prior to doing that, this project will go through various aspects of the business in order to examine the feasibility of the business idea and its worth. Additionally, some details and statistical analyses will be provided along with some visualizations that illustrate the idea better.

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

### Initial Look at the Project
The main purpose of this analysis is to examine the worth of the business idea and whether it is a good fit for investors to invest in. This analysis attempted to answer some important questions about the project, such as (1) what is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers, and (2) what are the peak hours for bike rentals? Over all, there were over two and a quarter million trips that occured in the month of August alone. When investigating that number further, the analysis showed that 81% of these trips were made by existing subscribers (1,900,359 subscriber), and the remaining 19% were regular customers. Furthermore, the peak hours of these trips seemed to be between 4 pm to 8 pm. This is important to know so that enough bikes are supplied for the customers in the time of need.
